# 🏆 Best GitHub Discussions Setup (Low Maintenance)

## Learning from the Champions

### 1. **Next.js** - Self-Sustaining Community
- **Categories**: Just 5 (Ideas, Help, Show & Tell, Polls, General)
- **Secret**: Community answers itself - maintainers rarely needed
- **Auto-features**:
  - "Mark as answer" for Q&A
  - Community voting surfaces best content
  - Pinned FAQ reduces repeat questions

### 2. **Astro** - Template-Driven
- **Smart move**: Discussion templates for each category
- **Result**: Users self-categorize correctly
- **Time saved**: No manual sorting needed

### 3. **Prisma** - Bot Automation
- **GitHub Actions**: Auto-label, auto-close stale discussions
- **Community champions**: Give trusted users moderation rights
- **Result**: Runs itself

### 4. **Tailwind CSS** - Minimal Categories
- **Just 4 categories**: Help, Ideas, Show, Announcements
- **Why it works**: Less choice = less confusion
- **Maintenance**: Almost zero

## 🎯 Your Low-Maintenance Setup

### Reduce to 5 Essential Categories:
1. **🙏 Help** (Q&A with answers) - Community helps itself
2. **🎉 Show & Tell** - Users share wins
3. **💡 Ideas** - Feature requests with voting
4. **📣 Announcements** - You post occasionally
5. **💬 General** - Everything else

### Enable These GitHub Features:
```bash
# These run automatically:
- Answers can be marked (crowdsources support)
- Upvoting surfaces best content
- Search helps users find existing answers
```

### Create 3 Pinned Posts Only:
1. **Welcome + Rules** (the one we created)
2. **FAQ** (top 10 questions - update quarterly)
3. **Quick Start Guide** (links to all tools)

### Set Up GitHub Actions (10 min):
```yaml
# .github/workflows/discussions.yml
name: Discussions Maintenance
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Weekly
jobs:
  close-stale:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/stale@v5
        with:
          stale-issue-message: 'Auto-closing due to inactivity'
          days-before-stale: 30
          days-before-close: 7
```

### Community Champions (Key Strategy):
- Identify 2-3 power users
- Give them "Triage" permission
- They handle 90% of moderation

### Time Commitment:
- **Week 1**: 30 min setup
- **Ongoing**: 5-10 min/week
- **Check quarterly**: Update FAQ

## 🏁 The "Set and Forget" Approach

**Most successful pattern**: Let the community run itself
- Users help users
- Voting surfaces quality
- Search reduces repeats
- Templates guide behavior

**Your only jobs**:
1. Post announcements for releases
2. Pin occasional champion posts
3. Thank helpful community members

**What NOT to do**:
- Don't answer every question yourself
- Don't create too many categories
- Don't over-moderate
- Don't stress about daily activity

## 📊 Success Without Burnout

**NASA's approach**: They have discussions but rarely participate. Community runs itself.

**React's approach**: Core team posts announcements only. Community handles everything else.

**Your approach**: Be the FORMAT AUTHORITY, not the help desk. Let dot.faffers help dot.faffers.
