## 🏆 The Philosophy

`.faf` isn't just a file format - it's a movement. We believe:

- Context is everything in AI development
- Speed matters (every millisecond counts)
- Tools should work FOR you, not against you
- The community wins when everyone wins

## 📊 Real Achievement, Real Community

This isn't marketing fluff. These are real tools, built with thousands of hours of work, validated by real developers. We're here because we've experienced the transformation ourselves.

From 20 minutes of context prep down to 3 minutes. From manual copy-paste to automated excellence. From FAFfing about to getting things done.
